							<p class="fs-5 mb-1">As one of the most polluting industries in the world, fashion has woken up to its enormous impact on the environment.</p>
							<p class="fs-5 mb-5">Striving to contribute to repair catastrophic climate change and reach social justice, AFYLA found its identity in sustainability.</p>
							<p class="fs-5 fw-medium mb-5">“IT’S PRETTY SIMPLE NO LEATHER, NO SKIN, NO FUR, NO POLYESTER, NO PLASTIC, NO DISCRIMINATION NO INJUSTICE.“</p>
							<p class="fs-5 mb-5">Our sustainability practices are divided into 7 pillars: Environment, people, animals, packaging & labeling, material we use, material we don’t use and community initiatives.</p>

							<h1 class="fw-medium mb-5">ENVIRONMENT</h1>
							<p class="fs-5 mb-5">We are aware with the climate change and the importance to preserve mother nature. In order to reduce our carbon footprint, we engage in planting a tree for each purchase we receive.</p>
							<p class="fs-5 mb-5">We are also zero-tolerant with the use of plastic in our supply chain. We only RE-use plastic or use recycled one and that’s only to protect our garments in stock.</p>
							<p class="fs-5">In order to reduce waste, we produce small batch production along with quality manufacturing. To ensure low footprint impact, we work with local artisans and suppliers as much as we could.</p>

							<h1 class="fw-medium mb-5">PEOPLE</h1>
							<p class="fs-5 mb-5">As an industry that runs on a systemic inequality and social injustice, it is crucial to put an end to these issues.</p>
							<p class="fs-5 mb-5">In our hiring process, we don’t consider any of these; race, gender, religion, age and social position. We choose to hire people based on their competence and skills that are adequate for our needs. And we make sure to pay them ethical living wages.</p>
							<p class="fs-5 mb-1">We ensure to give power to our workers voices and to provide practices that support equitable working conditions.</p>
							<p class="fs-5">We are extremely against any form of discrimination or assault. We also don’t tolerate child or forced labor, you can read more about it in our <l :href="route('page', 'zero-tolerance-policy')" class="text-dark underline">Zero Tolerance Policy</l>.</p>
